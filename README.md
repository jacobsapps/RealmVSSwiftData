# Perf Test for CoreData, SwiftData and Realm

Comparing the performance characteristics of Realm, SwiftData and CoreData.

Code accompanying the Emerge Tools blog article:
[SwiftData vs Realm: Performance Comparison](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/swiftdata-vs-realm-performance-comparison)

## Issues

- UUID init is superfluous in all but Realm? CD/SQLite can do the primary keys.
- Delete all users could be just a database table drop/recreate?

## Numbers

M2 Mac Mini Pro, Xcode 16 b2, running in simulator

- SwiftData and CoreData can grow big, e.g. SwiftData >6GB of RAM for the 1m 
  user inserts, or CoreData >2GB of RAM for the "complex" 100k run.
